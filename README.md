Porosity and permeability are fundamental petrophysical properties that govern the storage and flow capacity of reservoir rocks. Accurate estimation of these parameters is crucial for efficient reservoir evaluation, management, and production forecasting. Although core analysis provides reliable measurements, it is often costly, labor-intensive, and limited in depth coverage. Conventional empirical models have also failed to fully capture the complex, nonlinear relationships inherent in subsurface formations. To address these limitations, this study proposes a wrapper-based input feature selection approach using Genetic Algorithm (GA) integrated with Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) for improved prediction of porosity and permeability from well log data. The study utilized petrophysical well log data from well 15/19-F-1B (Statoil Petroleum), covering a depth interval of 3229.4 to 3441.9 m. Data preprocessing involved linear interpolation for missing values and z-score normalisation for uniform scaling. A multilayer perceptron (MLP) ANN with ReLU activation was implemented in Python using Keras. GA was employed to identify the most relevant subset of input features, and model performance was evaluated using Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Coefficient of Determination (R²). Results showed that GA-ANN selected RHOB, NPHI, GR, and DT as the most relevant inputs. Validation performance slightly improved for permeability (R² from 0.9698 to 0.9740; RMSE −7.6%) and remained stable for porosity (R² ≈ 0.993; RMSE -2%). The GA-ANN model achieved comparable accuracy with reduced complexity, enhancing generalization and mitigating overfitting. The study concludes that GA-assisted feature selection effectively optimizes ANN-based petrophysical predictions. Future research should explore hybrid feature selection, multi-objective fitness functions, and larger multi-field datasets for improved model robustness and generalization.
